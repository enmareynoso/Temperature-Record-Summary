# Temperature record summary üå°Ô∏è
This project provides a solution for calculating the minimum, maximum, and average temperature measures from temperature data stored in flat, JSON, and XML files. The solution uses the template method design pattern to provide a base class for processing temperature data and subclasses for each file type.
